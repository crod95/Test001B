In this game, you control the a small helicopter that is running around the
desert collecting the small shiny orbs scattered around the level. Use either
arrow keys or the 'W', 'A'-'S'-'D' keys to move around the map on the x and y 
plane. Use the 'C' key to change the camera view from third-person to first-
person and vice versa. Once you have collected all of the shiny orbs (there
will be 6 of them), the door to the next area will be open. In that area, 
collect the next the 4 floating cubes to open the final door.
